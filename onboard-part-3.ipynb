    "Do you remember the histograms we did previously? One thing that is important to notice is the range of values of each feature: the body mass varies from 2700 up to 6300 grams, while the culmen depth can have values between 13 and 21.5 mm. In other words, the scale of the features are not the same.\n",

    "It can be a problem when we want to use clustering models because, in general, these models are based on the idea of comparing distances between data points and when we have different value ranges, a feature may unintentionally gain more relevance over another one. That is why we should normalize the data! There are many different techniques to do so, and depending on your intentions, you may prefer one over another. In some cases, you are more interested in putting all features in a same range of values; in other cases, you want your data to follow a normal distribution or you just want to deal with smaller values (like the square root of the original ones).
